## Seeing this page below after hitting http://localhost:3000 again?

![trylocal](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/e958e7e4-6d42-44d1-a5cf-a090911f062c)

### Congratulations! you successfully installed UbiquiBot (new or to an existing app)


## Update an Existing Github App (bot)

**After you hit http://localhost:3000 you have the option to edit an existing app (if you think you have already registered a bot and when to reuse that same app)**
![existing](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/f696f3c1-1941-4bf4-b7a8-95d88f63e030)

**on your Github settings hit to:**

![repoaccess](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/bb389559-aaec-4bec-8ac0-97cefea63b16)

**hen at the same time hit to "APP SETTINGS"**


**Update the WebHook URL by the one auto-provided by the bot's installation page (this is a must) and edit the webhook secret that you'll use at .env**

![secret](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/41e9d872-f628-491e-8156-31bec8870ae7)

**Update APP_ID at .env accordingly**

![ubiqui](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/a760b497-84f2-4574-aa49-757be3dc3e71)

**In the same page it is super important that you re-generated and save a private key that you'll be using at .env you open the file and paste it**

![logo](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/716639d4-4646-4f14-bc3f-a39cfaf0fada)


## The Good News it's after you install the bot by using an existing app you'll get

![success](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/87e85b37-c077-41f1-a7dc-41047d8a3b20)


**Important things with private keys (.pem) at .env**

1. The private key gets automatically filled after the app is installed to a github handle but not as an existing app
2. The private key cannot be separated in spaces
3. The private key is a string into its env var rather than a just opened info without "" otherwise it will not be recognized and you'll get unauthorized access


**Note:** When setting up the project, please do not rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` as it will delete the environment example from the repository.
Instead, it is recommended to make a copy of the `.env.example` file and replace the values with the appropriate ones.

## Overview

- This bot is available as a GitHub Action.
- The code must be compiled using `@vercel/ncc` because all the dependencies (e.g. `node_modules`) must be included and committed on the repository for the GitHub Actions runner to use.

## How to use

1. Go to the [UbiquiBot App Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/ubiquibot)
2. Choose a plan and install UbiquiBot on your repository
3. Congratulations! You can now use the UbiquiBot to manage your tasks.

To test the bot, you can:

1. Create a new issue
2. Add a time label, ex: `Time: <1 Day`
3. Add a priority label, ex: `Priority: 1 (Normal)`
4. At this point the bot should add a price label.

## Configuration

`evmNetworkId` is ID of the EVM-compatible network that will be used for payouts.

`priceMultiplier` is a base number that will be used to calculate task price based on the following formula: `price = priceMultiplier * timeLabelWeight * priority-label-weight * 100`

`timeLabels` are labels for marking the time limit of the task:

- `name` is a human-readable name
- `value` is number of seconds that corresponds to the time limit of the task

`priorityLabels` are labels for marking the priority of the task:

- `name` is a human-readable name

`commandSettings` are setting to enable or disable a command

- `name` is the name of the command
- `enabled` is a `true` or `false` value to enable or disable a command

`defaultLabels` are labels that are applied when an issue is created without any time or priority labels.

`assistivePricing` to create a new pricing label if it doesn't exist. Can be `true` or `false`.

`disableAnalytics` can be `true` or `false` that disables or enables weekly analytics collection by Ubiquity.

`paymentPermitMaxPrice` sets the max amount for automatic payout of tasks when the issue is closed.

`commentIncentives` can be `true` or `false` that enable or disable comment incentives. These are payments generated for comments in the issue by contributors, excluding the assignee.

`issueCreatorMultiplier` is a number that defines a base multiplier for calculating incentive for the creator of the issue.

`comment-element-pricing` defines how much is a part of the comment worth. For example `text: 0.1` means that any text in the comment will add 0.1

`incentives` defines incentive rewards:

- `comment` defines comment rewards:
  - `elements` defines reward value for HTML elements such as `p`, `img`, `a`.
  - `totals`:
    - `word` defines reward for each word in the comment

`maxConcurrentAssigns` is the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to a task hunter at once. This excludes tasks with delayed or approved pull request reviews.

`registerWalletWithVerification` can be `true` or `false`. If enabled, it requires a signed message to set wallet address. This prevents users from setting wallet address from centralized exchanges, which would make payments impossible to claim.

`promotionComment` is a message that is appended to the payment permit comment.

### Supase Database

### Option 1

1. Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). Add `Project URL` and `API Key` to the `.env` file:

```

SUPABASE_URL="XXX"
SUPABASE_KEY="XXX"

```

### Option 2

Supabase comes with a [readme](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/blob/development/supabase/README.md) which is helpful for managing and setup
### This options will require you to have a local Docker installation (under the hood it is required by Supabase) refer to [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs)

```
bun supabase start
```

## Check Supabase Status (locally)
```
bun supabase status
```

![supabase](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/assets/41552663/e8709b8f-e7c3-49e0-876c-c15dde22c6d2)

## Supabase Studio

You can then access to Supabase Studio by going to http://localhost:54323


2. Add `FOLLOW_UP_TIME` and `DISQUALIFY_TIME` to the `.env` file if you don't want to use default ones.

```

FOLLOW_UP_TIME="4 days" // 4 days
DISQUALIFY_TIME="7 days" // 7 days

```

3. `Make sure you have Node => 20.10.0 && bun`
4. Open 2 terminal instances:
   - in one instance run `bun tsc --watch` (compiles the Typescript code)
   - in another instance run `bun start:watch` (runs the bot locally)
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` and follow instructions to add the bot to one of your repositories.

At this point the `.env` files auto-fill the empty fields (`PRIVATE_KEY` and `APP_ID`) if it is not previously filled.
Now you can make changes to the repository on GitHub (e.g. add a task) and the bot should react.

6. After adding the bot (as a installed app) to your github you will need to restart the aforementioned `bun start:watch`` so CTRL-C to stop the node daemon and `bun start:watch` again

You can, for example:

1. Create a new issue
2. Add a time label, ex: `Time: <1 Day`
3. Add a priority label, ex: `Priority: 1 (Normal)`
4. the bot should add a price label, you should see event logs in your opened bot terminals

## How it works

UbiquiBot is built using the [probot](https://probot.github.io/) framework so in fact the bot is a github app. But thanks to the [probot/adapter-github-actions](https://github.com/probot/adapter-github-actions) you can also use the bot as a github action.

[UbiquiBot](https://github.com/marketplace/ubiquibot) it's also available ready to install on the GitHub Marketplace.

When using as a github app the flow is the following:

1. UbiquiBot is added to a repository as a github app
2. You run the bot "backend" (for example on your local machine)
3. Some event happens in a repository and the bot should react somehow (for example: on adding a time label to an issue the bot should add a price label)
4. Event details are sent to your deployed bot instance (to a webhook URL that was set in github app's settings)
5. The bot handles the event

## Payments Permits in a local instance

For payment to work in your local instance, ubiquibot must be set up in a Github organization. It will not work for a ubiquibot instance set up in a personal account. Once, you have an ubiquibot instance working in an organization, follow the steps given below:

1. Create a new private repository in your Github organization with name `ubiquibot-config`
2. Add your ubiquibot app to `ubiquibot-config` repository.
3. Create a file `.github/ubiquibot-config.yml` in it. Fill the file with contents from [this file](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/blob/development/.github/ubiquibot-config.yml).
4. Go to https://pay.ubq.fi/keygen and generate X25519 public/private key pair. Fill private key of your wallet's address in `PLAIN_TEXT` field and click `Encrypt`.
5. Copy the `CIPHER_TEXT` and append it to your repo `ubiquibot-config/.github/ubiquibot-config.yml` as

   `private-key-encrypted: "PASTE_YOUR_CIPHER_TEXT_HERE"`

6. Copy the `X25519_PRIVATE_KEY` and append it in your local ubiquibot repository `.env` file as

   `X25519_PRIVATE_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_X25519_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE`

## How to QA any additions to the bot

Make sure you have your local instance of [ubiquibot running](#quickstart).

1. Fork the ubiquibot repo and add your local instance of ubiquibot to the forked repository.
2. Enable Github action running on the forked repo and allow `issues` on the settings tab.
3. Create a [QA issue](https://github.com/ubiquibot/staging/issues/21) similar to this where you show the feature working in the forked repo.
4. Describe carefully the steps taken to get the feature working, this way our team can easily verify.
5. Link that QA issue to the pull request as indicated on the template before requesting a review.

## How to create a new release

1. Update the version in package.json: `bun version --new-version x.x.x`
2. Commit and create a new tag: `git commit -am x.x.x && git tag -am x.x.x`
3. Push tags: `git push origin v"x.x.x"`
4. The Github action will create a release by recognizing the version tag
